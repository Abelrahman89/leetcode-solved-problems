 IQ question:
 There are 100 bulbs arranged in a row. Each bulb has its own switch and is currently turned off.  In the first round, you turn every switch on. In the second round, you flip the switch of every second bulb (i.e. bulb 2, 4, 6, 8 and so on). In the third round, you flip the switch of every third bulb and so on. How many bulbs are turned on after 88 rounds ?
 (1,4,9,16,25,36,49,64, 81 =(9+11 =20 bulbs were lit after 88 pass )
